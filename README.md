# Facial-models
This contains source code,trained models and testing codes for COMSYS-2025 hackathon for team OpticEdge.


Task-A folder contains the source code which is used to obtain the checkpoint. 
To execute testing code u need to change the file_path and checkpoint path inside it. Details are given inside the notebook. 

Same for Task-B. The only difference is that instead of a checkpoint, a path file has been used. 

USAGE OF KAGGLE IS HIGHLY REQUESTED AS THE CODE HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN THAT ENVIRONMENT

In case you wish to run source codes, please use the following datasets : 

Task-A : 

Raw data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anubhabbhattacharya7/comsys-taska/data

The following datasets are downloaded on running the source code. However, these are provided for easy access : 

Preprocessed data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohammandal001/new-preprocessed-images-task-a-comsys-25k/data

Face detection model files :
