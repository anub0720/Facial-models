# Facial-models
This contains source code,trained models and testing codes for COMSYS-2025 hackathon for team OpticEdge.


Task-A folder contains the source code which is used to obtain the checkpoint. 
To execute testing code u need to change the file_path and checkpoint path inside it. Details are given inside the notebook. 

Same for Task-B. The only difference is that instead of a checkpoint, a path file has been used.
